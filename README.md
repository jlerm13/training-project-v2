## CORE HYPOTHESIS (REVISED)

### The Problem Statement
Coaches have **athlete management tools** (TeamBuildr, TeamWorks, Bridge) but need **coaching tools** that:
- Let them program the "destination" (macro periodization framework)
- Allow athletes to navigate the path based on their constraints (equipment, schedule, readiness)
- Don't force coaches to either over-program (creating 10 variations) OR manually manage everything

**Current Reality:**
- Coaches use TeamBuildr for data tracking, NOT for in-session workouts
- They write workouts on whiteboards because individualization is too manual
- They either create rigid programs that athletes can't follow, or spend hours creating variations
- Athletes skip workouts during breaks/travel because programs don't fit their constraints

### The Solution Model (CLARIFIED)

**What we're actually building:**
1. **Coach programs ONCE** - Creates macro periodization framework (4-day strength block, exercise selection, set/rep schemes, progression model)
2. **Athlete completes ONE-TIME SETUP** - Answers 3 questions about schedule, equipment access, limitations
3. **App automatically adapts** - Shows personalized version of coach's program matched to athlete's context
4. **Optional micro-adjustments** - Athlete CAN swap exercise variations or adjust volume if needed, but doesn't HAVE to

**This is NOT:**
- ❌ Athlete makes decisions every workout (too much friction)
- ❌ Coach has to approve every adaptation (defeats the time-saving purpose)
- ❌ Completely automated AI programming (coach still creates framework)

**This IS:**
- ✅ Personalized prescription with optional autonomy
- ✅ Default = "just show me the workout" (cognitive ease)
- ✅ Escape hatches = "let me adjust if I need to" (flexibility)
- ✅ Coach maintains programming control, app handles individualization

## UPDATED HYPOTHESIS STATEMENT

**OLD:** "Athletes want autonomy to adapt workouts to their constraints."

**NEW:** "Athletes will complete more workouts when their coach's program is automatically adapted to their context (equipment/schedule), with the option to make micro-adjustments when needed."

**This changes what we're validating:**
- Not just "do athletes want flexibility?"
- But "will automated adaptation + optional adjustments improve completion rates?"
